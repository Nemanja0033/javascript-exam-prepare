    <h1>JavaScript Fundamentals | Variables</h1>
    <h4>In JavaScript, variables are used to store data values. You can declare variables using three keywords: var, let, and const. Here a quick overview:</h4>
    <br>
    <p><strong>var:</strong> This is the oldest way to declare variables. It has function scope, meaning its accessible within the function it was declared in. However, its less commonly used in modern JavaScript due to some quirks and issues with scope.</p>
    <br>    
    <p><strong>let:</strong>Introduced in ES6 (2015), let allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression where they are used. This is generally preferred over var for its block scope.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>const:</strong> Also introduced in ES6, const is used to declare variables that are read-only. Once a value is assigned to a const variable, it cannot be reassigned. However, if the variable holds an object, the properties of the object can still be modified.</p>
