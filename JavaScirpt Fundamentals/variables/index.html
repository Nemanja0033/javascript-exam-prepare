    <h1>JavaScript Fundamentals | Variables</h1>
    <h4>In JavaScript, variables are used to store data values. You can declare variables using three keywords: var, let, and const. Here a quick overview:</h4>
    <br>
    <p><strong>var:</strong> This is the oldest way to declare variables. It has function scope, meaning its accessible within the function it was declared in. However, its less commonly used in modern JavaScript due to some quirks and issues with scope.</p>
    <br>    
    <p><strong>let:</strong>Introduced in ES6 (2015), let allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression where they are used. This is generally preferred over var for its block scope.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>const:</strong> Also introduced in ES6, const is used to declare variables that are read-only. Once a value is assigned to a const variable, it cannot be reassigned. However, if the variable holds an object, the properties of the object can still be modified.</p>

        // 1. DECLARING AND INITIALIZING VARIABLES


       // var x; declaration

        //x = 5; initialization

        //var x = 5; declared and initialized variable

        //x = 10;

        //console.log(x);

        //varaibles can handle value change after initialization

        //let y = 5 

        //const z = 10

        // 2. VARIABLES NAME RULES


        //var myVariable = 10; valid named variable with camelCase method

        //var my_variable = 10;  also valid name used in javascirpt early days

       //var $myvariable = 10 valid name

       //var myVariable2 = 10  valid name (cannot start wiht number)

        // variables indetifier can have word, number , $, _

        //const MYVARIABLE = 5;  const are used to have an upperCase names

        //JavaSciprt is case-sensitive programming language 

        //exmp

       // console.log(myVariable);
       //console.log(MYVARIABLE);

       // 3. DEFAULT VALUE OF VARIABLE

      // let x; 
      //console.log(x); //undefined

      // 4. SCOPE

      // var - only in function
      // let - any block
      // const any block

      //let x = 'global variable'

     // {
        //let y = 'block variable'
     // }

     // var x = "*global variable*";
 
        //{
       // var y = "*block variable*";
        //}
        
       // document.write(x);
       // document.write(y)

       /*var x = "*global variable*";
 
        function myFunction() {
        var y = "*function variable*";
        }
        
        document.write(x);
        document.write(y);*/

        // 5. HOISTING 

        // Raise variables to the beginning of the document

        /*console.log(x)
        var x;*/

        /*console.log(x); //undefined
        var x = "variable value";*/  //hoisting can only raise a varaible declaration but not a value

        /*let x = 'outer scope';
        {
        console.log(x);  // but let variables can hoist a value 
        }*/
